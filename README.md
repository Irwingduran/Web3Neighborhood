Update: We used the concept of neighborhood governance to adapt it to competition in a hackathon (ETH 5 de Mayo), in Puebla. This helped us to take an abstract idea to competition, to turn that abstract idea into a prototype, to live with the community web3, to know other points of view of developers and other professions. 

This was an important step because we managed to be among the two best in our track (NEAR B.O.S.) and we have achieved greater reach with those people we want to benefit and get involved in our project.
